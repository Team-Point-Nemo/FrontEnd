# WeatherApp

We built a weather app as part of the Software Project 2 course, the further development of the application has come to a halt. The app allows users to view both current and future weather forecasts. Users can check real-time weather conditions with visualized view over map, detailed five day forecast and daily summaries for 16 days. Weather data is available for both user location and city search.
