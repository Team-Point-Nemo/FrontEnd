# WeatherApp

We are building a weather app as part of the Software Project 2 course. The app allows users to view both current and future weather forecasts. Users can check real-time weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and even receive weather alerts for their location.

## Technologies

### Frontend:
- **React Native**: A popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript.
- **Expo**: A set of tools and services to develop and deploy React Native applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides weather data, including real-time weather and forecasts.

### Version Control:
- **Git**: Version control system to track changes in the project.
- **GitHub**: For hosting and collaborating on the codebase.

### Testing:
- **Expo Go**: Used for running and testing the app on mobile devices.
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing of the app's components.
- **React Native Testing Library**: Provides utility functions for testing React Native components.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather**: Displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Weather Forecast**: View forecasts for the upcoming days, including detailed information on temperature, rain, and other factors.
- **Location-based Weather**: Automatically detects the user's location and shows weather data specific to that location.
- **Multi-location Support**: Add and view weather forecasts for multiple cities or locations.
- **Weather Alerts**: Receive notifications or alerts for severe weather conditions (e.g., thunderstorms, hurricanes).
- **Favorites-section** : Save your favorite locations to later view them quickly.
