# WeatherApp 

We are making a weather app for the course Software Project 2. The user can see the current and future weather.

## Technologies

We will be using React Native to make a mobile app. For project management and version control, we will use Github and Git.

The coding languages on Front end will be JavaScript and Tailwind.

For testing, we will use Expo Go. We will be testing the app both manually and using unit tests.

Additionally, we will practise using branches in Git.

## How to get started

Coming soon ;)
